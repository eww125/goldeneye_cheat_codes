880xxxFF 000A     GM10 Special Issue
880xxxD3 0006

With this code, you can have the GM10 Special Issue (not really a true
name) that has a 10 round clip, useful for getting into areas with a lot
of enemies. It requires a PP7, and if you don't have one, you will probably
have a silenced PP7, which you could substitute for the PP7. But when
you use up all of the magazine, you'll have to hit the GS button again for
a full 10 round clip. You will also have to select the level you want to
have the GM10 with.

800xxxFF 0001

First you have to have two controllers, then go into the controls in the
watch and switch it to domino. Use the second controller to use the weapon.
With this code, you can shoot any gun continuously with out reloading!
This code works best with All Guns. If you're working with 2x weapons,
only the gun on the right will have a bottomless magazine.
You need to specify the level you want to play this code in, by replacing
the xxx with the following digits:

want to get the cheat for. It may say you failed mission objectives, but it
should still come out okay.

No Clipping Codes Directions



1) Enter the codes below, exactly as they are here, in the order they are
listed. Only use one of the 3 no clipping codes at a time. And don't
enter more than one no clipping code for more than one level, enter a
code only for the level you are going to play!

2) Then, while you are in the level you put the codes in for, stand in
any position in the game, then press the L & R top shoulder buttons
together. Until you are transported farther away from your current
position. Turn around until you see the area you were in, you will be
able to see clearly only the area that you were last in, the rest
will be transparent. Walk back to that area, and walk around its
edges and shoot the enemies through the walls. You sometimes can't
shoot through the wall but if you get close enough to where you gun
barely sticks out the wall, then you can shoot the enemies there. Now
to turn the no clipping mode off, you need to go back to where you
press the L + R buttons together or at a position in the level that is
at the same height off of the ground, this will re position yourself
as on the ground level, then walk to the next place you want to use
it and repeat this step! The only thing that stinks about this code,
is that all the other rooms are transparent! Also, if you wish to use
this on a room that has the same floor level for the most of the
area, try climbing up the stairs a bit and press L + R, but, just
remember that you have to be back at that same position on the stairs
to turn the no clipping code off!!

3) A tip, when using this code, be sure to use the following code
80069669 0001 and go into the cheat menu and turn on the code that
says NO NAME cheat, which is the DEBUG MODE code, it will tell you
what room you are still in and it will show you your coordinates,
this will make it easier for you to get back on ground level by
remembering where you last were before by the coordinates! Also with
this code, it will sometimes put you in a position of which you cant
get out of, you will have to simply EXIT the level and start over!!

Have 4 Different Customized Players



8002B19F 00xx     Player 1
8002B19D 00xx

8002B253 00xx     Player 2
8002B251 00xx

8002B283 00xx     Player3
8002B281 00xx

8002B223 00xx     Player4
8002B221 00xx

These codes allow you to play four different customizaed players in
Multi-Player! The XXs represent where you would put your head and body.
For the top code to work, the player who wants to be that must select
Bond. Now, whoever wants to be the 2nd code from the top must select
the 2nd scientist. For the third code from the top, the player must select
the helicopter pilot for it to work. For the code at the bottom to work,
select Baron Samedi. Now, you can have four differernt customizaed
players at once!

8002B19F 00xx     Create your own characters!
8002B19D 00xx

The top code will be the head of the character in customization. The
bottom code will be the body the character. For an example, ??'s head
will be on ??'s body. There may be more heads and bodies, but this is a
big list. Some of the heads or bodies may make the character extra tiny,
or the game might freeze. To be this character, you must select Bond. Only
two drawbacks though. You can't be Bond and you can't have two different
customized players.

For the top code, replace xx with:
Caution: Some are extra tiny or might freeze! 0 - 49,
0A, 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A
0B, 1B, 2B, 3B, 4B

800696A1-0001     More Characters for Multiplayer *

First, make sure you have at least one cheat enabled already. Enter
800696A1-0001 as your code, and start the game up. Okay, now pay attention;
go to the cheats folder, exit the folder, go to the level select folder, and select
the dam. Press Start and abort the mission promptly. Go into multiplayer, and
you'll have more guys to choose from!


Note: When you put in the codes below, they will appear as "No Name" codes
in your Cheat Menu Options. Activate them and start a mission. The game
will beep. Go back to the Cheat Menu Options. Now you will have a new
cheat that will stay there without the GameShark. The "No Name" code
will disappear and the new cheat will remain when you start the game
without the Game Shark.

The base code to use is 800696xx 0001

Here's what you do, first, without using GS, fill up all the files, so that
there isn't any open ones. Then DELETE THE 2ND FILE ONLY, turn off the
N64. put in the GS, and turn on the code above, the second file shouldn't
be empty, it should be named 007, if it isn't, look for another one named
007, if you don't find anything, go to the empty file, and play on the Dam,
Agent mode would be the easiest. Beat that level, when the screen that
shows your time and weapon of choice... hit the B button until you come
to the place where you choose yer level, EVERY ONE SHOULD BE THERE,
hit B again and check out yer cheats file, ALL 23 SHOULD BE THERE...
When you pick your stage, you will see another difficulty level, 007,
this is the level editor, you can change all kinds of stuff...

Working Codes, and still beat the level
